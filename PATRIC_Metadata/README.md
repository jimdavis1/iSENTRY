# MetaData Cleanup Work, last updated 3-2020

This repo contains the up to date metadata cleanup work that has been done for the iSENTRY project using the data from PATRIC.

The objective of this work is to build clean metadata fields that describe bacterial pathogens and non pathogens for use in machine learning and other algorithmic prediction projects. 

PATRIC contains genomes and metadata from GenBank and other sources, including the literature and data for genomes assembled from SRA.

Datat that related to pathogenicity, and which might be most predictive for models include the following SOLR fields:

* host name
* body sample site
body sample subsite
other clinical
host health
isolation site
isolation source
